      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Now, this is a story all about how <br>
My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
And I'd like to take a minute<br>
Just sit right there<br>
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air<br><br>

In west Philadelphia born and raised<br>
On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br>
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school<br>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'<br><br>

I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br>
But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way<br>
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br>
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.<br><br>

First class, yo this is bad<br>
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br>
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?<br>
Hmmmmm this might be alright.<br><br>

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that<br>
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?<br>
I don't think so<br>
I'll see when I get there<br>
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air<br><br>

Well, the plane landed and when I came out<br>
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out<br>
I ain't trying to get arrested yet<br>
I just got here<br>
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br><br>

I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br>
If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'<br><br>

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'<br>
I looked at my kingdom<br>
I was finally there<br>
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
